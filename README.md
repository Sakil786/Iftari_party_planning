# Multi-Agent System for Iftari Party Planning
## Objective:
Your Iftari party planning system should not only suggest food items but also consider multiple factors like guest count, dietary preferences, available budget, and location (home vs restaurant).

The system includes the following agents:
1. **Guest Preference Classifier:** Determines dietary preferences of guests (Veg/Non-Veg).
2. **Dish Recommender:** Suggests Iftari dishes based on preference.
3. **Portion Estimator:** Calculates the quantity of food needed based on guest count.
4. **Budget Estimator:** Checks if the selected dishes fit within the budget.
5. **Venue Selector:** Decides whether to host at home or book a restaurant based on the budget and number of guests.
